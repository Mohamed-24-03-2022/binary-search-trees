# Tree Data Structure

This is an implementation of a tree data structure in JavaScript. The tree is created from an array of values by building a binary search tree, which is a type of tree where the value of each node is greater than all the nodes in its left sub-tree and less than all the nodes in its right sub-tree.

**Features**
Building a binary search tree from an array of values.
Sorting and removing duplicated values from the array before building the tree.
Finding for a specific value in the tree.
Inserting a new value in the tree (only on leaf nodes).
Removing a value from the tree.
Traversing the tree in breadth-first level order.
Traversing the tree in depth-first level order preorder, inorder and postorder.
Finding tree's height.
Finding node's height.
Finding node's depth.
Checking if the tree is balanced.
Rebalancing an unbalanced trees.

**Dependencies**
The code makes use of the following dependencies: (which i wrote)

mergeSort from ./mergeSort.js: sorts the input array
checkDuplicated from ./checkDuplicated.js: removes duplicated values from the input array
